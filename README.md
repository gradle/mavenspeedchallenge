# Gradle and Maven Build Speed Challenge

## Quick Links

- [Instructions for Maven](#instructions-for-maven)

## How It Works

Challengers will get a chance to speed up their Gradle and Maven builds by trying out our Gradle (https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_cache.html) or Maven (https://docs.gradle.com/enterprise/maven-build-cache/) Build Cache and can verify their results using our free Build Scan(tm)(https://scans.gradle.com/).

To participate, all you'll need to do is enable caching in scanning in Gradle, or add the free Develocity extension to the Maven project of your choice and connect to our contest events server. You'll run a cached build and email us a screenshot of your cache savings from the free Build Scan(tm) interface. 

# Instructions for Gradle

### Step 1 

Start with the Gradle project of your choice.  If you'd rather not use a real project that you are working on, feel free to clone an open source one!  Note that project details such as dependencies, console logs, and failure messages will be captured during the scan.  Here's everything that the scan will pick up:  (https://docs.gradle.com/enterprise/gradle-plugin/#captured_information)

Here are some alternatives, but remember any Gradle project will do!

 - Create a Spring Initializr Gradle Project: ([Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/#!type=gradle-project-kotlin&language=java&platformVersion=3.0.1&packaging=jar&jvmVersion=11&groupId=com.speedchallenge&artifactId=gradledemo&name=gradledemo&description=Demo%20project%20for%20the%20Gradle%20and%20Maven%20Speed%20Challenge&packageName=com.speedchallenge.gradledemo))
 - Grails OSS Project:  https://github.com/grails/grails-core
 - Mockito OSS Project: https://github.com/mockito/mockito
 - Groovy OSS Project:  https://github.com/apache/groovy

### Step 2

Note:  These instructions are for Gradle 6.x and above.  For instructions on **Gradle 5.x and previous**, please see the instructions here: https://docs.gradle.com/enterprise/gradle-plugin/ 

Connect your project to our events server by adding the following to your settings.gradle or settings.gradle.kts file:

**Groovy**

settings.gradle
```
plugins {
   id 'com.gradle.enterprise' version '3.12.1'
}

 ...

gradleEnterprise {
    server = "https://events.gradle.com/"
}
```
You may use the sample settings.gradle file included in this project if you'd like.

**Kotlin**

settings.gradle.kts
```
plugins {
  id("com.gradle.build-scan").version("3.12.1")
}

...

gradleEnterprise {
    server = "https://events.gradle.com/"
}
```

### Step 3

Enable caching in your build by adding the following to your gradle.properties file:

```
org.gradle.caching=true
```
You may use the sample gradle.properties file included in this project if you'd like.

### Step 4

Run a build with a Build Scan:

>gradle build --scan

Or you can use the gradlew wrapper if you prefer. The first build will get a baseline score, and will publish a Build Scan(tm) for you to view. You will see a URL to the Build Scan in your build output which you can follow to view the Build Scan:

```
 $î‚° gradle build --scan

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 1s
10 actionable tasks: 10 executed

Publishing build scan...                   <---| Publishes Build Scan
https://events.gradle.com/s/dgvcb633be24i  <---| Outputs URL
```

Feel free to check it out! For the contest, the most important screen will be Performance -> Task execution -> Avoidance Savings:

![Build Scan Avoidance Savings without Caching for Gradle](build-scan-performance-goals-0-avoid-gradle.jpg)

The first time you run it, nothing will have been cached, so your avoidance will be 0% on the first pass.

### Step 5

Run a clean build with a Build Scan turned on: 

```
gradle clean build --scan
```

This will run the same build again, but will pull reusable entries from the Gradle Build Cache.  This time you should see significant avoidance savings, visible through the Performance Tab as described in Step 4 above.

# Instructions for Maven

### Step 1

Start with the Maven project of your choice.  If you'd rather not use a real project that you are working on, feel free to clone an open source one!  Note that project details such as dependencies, console logs, and failure messages will be captured during the scan. Here's everything that the scan will pick up:  (https://docs.gradle.com/enterprise/gradle-plugin/#captured_information)

Here are some alternatives, but remember any Maven project will do!

- Create a Spring Initializr Maven Project ([Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/#!type=maven-project&language=java&platformVersion=3.0.1&packaging=jar&jvmVersion=11&groupId=com.speedchallenge&artifactId=mavendemo&name=mavendemo&description=Demo%20project%20for%20the%20Gradle%20and%20Maven%20Speed%20Challenge&packageName=com.speedchallenge.mavendemo))
- Maven Multi-Module Example (https://github.com/jitpack/maven-modular)
- Spring Boot Apache Camel Archetype:
```
mvn archetype:generate \
  -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.camel.archetypes \
  -DarchetypeArtifactId=camel-archetype-spring-boot
```
- Maven Build Scan Quickstart (https://github.com/gradle/maven-build-scan-quickstart)

### Step 2

Add the Develocity Maven Extension and configure it to use the `events.gradle.com` server, run:

```sh
mvn com.gradle:gradle-enterprise-maven-extension:1.20.1:init \
  -Dgradle.enterprise.url=https://events.gradle.com
```

### Step 3

Run the first build with:

```
mvn clean verify
```

The first build will get a baseline score, and will publish a Build Scan(tm) for you to view. You will see the URL present in the console output of the build:

```
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] Total time:  5.480 s
[INFO] Finished at: 2023-01-03T16:09:28-05:00
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] 10 goals, 10 executed
[INFO] 
[INFO] Publishing build scan...                   <---| Publishes Build Scan
[INFO] https://events.gradle.com/s/qqrqortxcnexg  <---| Outputs URL
[INFO] 
```

 Feel free to check it out!  For the contest, the most important screen will be Performance -> Goal execution -> Avoidance Savings:

![Build Scan Avoidance Savings](build-scan-performance-goals-0-avoid.jpg)

The first time you run it, nothing will have been cached, so your avoidance will be 0% on the first pass.

### Step 4
  
Run the build again, using the same command:

>mvn clean verify

The second will run the same build again, but will pull reusable entries from the Maven Build Cache.  This time you should see significant avoidance savings, visible through the Performance Tab as described in Step 4 above!
